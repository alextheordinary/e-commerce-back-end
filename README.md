# e-commerce-back-end

The contents of this repository are the back-end of an e-commerce website. Deployment of this application requires a running MySQL server. The included schema.sql file must be run on the server in order for the application to work.

This application provides the back-end to create, read, update, and delete categories, products, and tags. All of this information is stored in a database called ecommerce_db.
